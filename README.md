# A-Smoother-Way-to-Train-Structured-Prediction-Models



Visual Object Localization using  [Casimir-toolbox](https://github.com/krishnap25/casimir).A toolbox of selected optimization algorithms including Casimir-SVRG (as well as the special cases of Catalyst-SVRG and SVRG) for unstructured tasks such as binary classification, and structured prediction tasks such as object localization or named entity recognition. This is code accompanying the paper "[A Smoother Way to Train Structured Prediction Models](https://krishnap25.github.io/papers/2018_neurips_smoother.pdf)" in NeurIPS 2018.
